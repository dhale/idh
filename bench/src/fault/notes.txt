Sign conventions for fault strike, dip, and throw

strike in (-90,90], dip in [-45,45]
dip ambiguous for strike = 90 degrees
dip has +- discontinuity
as strike goes from -89 to 89 degrees

strike in [0:360), dip in [0:45)
strike ambiguous for dip = 0 degrees
strike has 180 degree discontinuity
as dip goes through vertical

3D fault displacements

do not try to make fault surfaces for warping
instead build fault trees for warping with TSDP
each node in the tree has 
  one or two vertical nabors
  one or two horizontal nabors
  node nabors depend on fault likelihoods, strikes and dips
    strike and dip define local above, below, left and right
  nabors must be symmetric
    each node is a nabor of its nabors
tree leaves are nodes with only one nabor

before warping, ...
must compute for each node an array of errors for different shifts
  shifts are measured in vertical samples along fault dips
  errors are differences between image values squared
    for image values on opposite sides of fault
  when computing errors for one node
    must collect two sequences alongside (not on) fault
      need samples on opposite two sides of fault
        two sides determined locally by fault strike and dip
      when gathering samples along the fault
        use only samples above and below the node
        but include samples that may not be node nabors
          require only consistency with fault dip and strike
          if no consistent sample, then set large error for that shift
            extrapolate using dip and strike of nearest consistent sample

DTW (1D): 
  model: f(i) ~ g(i+u(i))
  minimize sum of errors (abs, squared, ...)
  subject to constraints:
    umin <= u(i) <= umax
    |u(i)-u(i-1)| <= b
    
  e = |f - g|^2
  d = accumulate e left to right
  u = backtrack d right to left

accumulate <=> smooth
  dlr = accumulate e left to right
  drl = accumulate e right to left
  es = dlr+drl-e (subtract e, so we do not count e twice)
  do DTW using es instead of e
    ds = accumulate es left to right
    u = backtrack ds right to left
  
DIW (2D):
  model: f(i1,i2) ~ g(i1+u(i1,i2),i2) <- shift only i1
  subject to constraints:
    umin <= u(i1,i2) <= umax
    |u(i1,i2)-u(i1-1,i2)| <= b1
    |u(i1,i2)-u(i1,i2-1)| <= b2
