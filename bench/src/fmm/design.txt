ImagePainter2

LocalDiffusionTensors2[n2][n1] (structure tensors)

Representation:
float[n2][n1] image (the image to be painted, not yet used)
float[n2][n1] paint (the painted values)
byte[n2][n1] flags (status of samples)
  CLEAR = 0 (no paint value)
  FIXED = 1 (fixed paint value)
  EXTRA = 2 (extrapolated paint value)
  INTER = 3 (interpolated paint value)

Algorithm summary:
Mark all samples either CLEAR or FIXED.
Extrapolate samples CLEAR -> EXTRA.
Interpolate samples EXTRA -> INTER.

Extrapolate detail:
Initialize time map using fixed samples.
  After this step, all samples marked either CLEAR or FIXED.
Complete time map using FMM to extrapolate.
  After this step, all samples are marked either EXTRA or FIXED.

Interpolate detail:
While any sample is marked EXTRA, ...
  choose the extrapolated sample with greatest time
  update time map via FMM while accumulating paint value
  mark sample interpolated (INTER)

Why are detailed byte flags necessary or useful?
(Why not have only fixed or not-fixed?)
Because we may want to want to know the state of samples during 
time-consuming paint operations. For example, during extrapolation
might display fixed, extrapolated or clear samples differently.

int n1 = number of samples in 1st dimension
int n2 = number of samples in 2nd dimension
int nc = count of clear samples
int nf = count of fixed samples
int ne = count of extrapolated samples
int ni = count of interpolated samples

The time map contains, for each sample, information related to the 
nearest known sample, where "nearest" means least time, not distance.
int[n2][n1] k1 = index in 1st dimension of nearest known sample
int[n2][n1] k2 = index in 2nd dimension of nearest known sample
float[n2][n1] tk = time to nearest known sample

Two priority queues (binary heaps) are necessary.
  1st is a min-heap, used in FMM to find next FAR 
    sample with the smallest time.
  2nd is a max-heap, used to determine where to next interpolate
    and update the time map.
  At some time, each of these queues may be almost as large as the image.
  Entries in the queues are sample indices (i1,i2).
  Compare entries by comparing times tk[i2][i1].

Use FMM to compute all times for samples not FIXED.
For FMM, need
  byte[n2][n1] flags (FAR=0,NEAR=1,DONE=2,CHANGED=3)
    For efficiency, should be able to repeat FMM for different sources 
    without resetting all of the flags. Instead, should keep track of 
    the current BASE for the flags; then FAR = BASE, NEAR = FAR+1, etc.
