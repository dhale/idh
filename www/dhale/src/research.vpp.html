    A blended neighbor method for image-guided interpolation enables 
    resampling of borehole data onto a uniform 3D sampling grid,
    without picking horizons and without flattening seismic images.
    Borehole measurements gridded in this way become new 3D images of
    subsurface properties.
    Property values conform to geologic layers and faults apparent in 
    the seismic image that guided the interpolation.

    The freely available Teapot Dome data set, which includes a 3D seismic 
    image, horizons picked from that image, and numerous well logs, 
    provides an ideal demonstration of image-guided interpolation of 
    borehole data.
    In this example, seismic horizons picked by others coincide with thin 
    layers apparent in the new 3D images of interpolated borehole data,
    even though the horizons were not used in the interpolation process.

    Uniformly sampled images are often used to interpolate other data acquired 
    more sparsely with an entirely different mode of measurement.
    For example, downhole tools enable geophysical properties to be measured
    with high precision near boreholes that are scattered spatially, 
    and less precise seismic images acquired at the earth's surface are used 
    to interpolate those properties at locations far away from the boreholes.
    <em>Image-guided interpolation</em> is designed specifically to enhance 
    this process.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Most existing methods for interpolation require distances from points
    where data will be interpolated to nearby points where data are known.
    Image-guided interpolation requires non-Euclidean distances in metric 
    tensor fields that represent the coherence, orientations and shapes
    of features in images.
    This requirement leads to a new method for interpolating scattered data 
    that I call <em>blended neighbor interpolation</em>.
    For simple Euclidean distances, blended neighbor interpolation resembles 
    the classic natural neighbor interpolation.

<h3>
Structure-oriented smoothing and semblance

  </dt>
  <dd>
    Smoothing along structures apparent in seismic images can enhance these 
    structural features while preserving important discontinuities such as 
    faults or channels.
    Filters appropriate for such smoothing must seamlessly adapt to 
    variations in the orientation and coherence of image features.
    I describe an implementation of smoothing filters that does this 
    and is both computationally efficient and simple to implement.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Structure-oriented filters lead naturally to the computation of 
    structure-oriented semblance, an attribute commonly used to
    highlight discontinuities in seismic images.
    Semblance is defined in this paper as simply the ratio of a 
    squared smoothed-image to a smoothed squared-image.
    This definition of semblance generalizes that commonly used today,
    because an unlimited variety of smoothing filters can be used to 
    compute the numerator and denominator images in the semblance ratio.
    The smoothing filters described in this paper yield an especially 
    flexible method for computing structure-oriented semblance.

<h3>
Apparent horizontal displacements
in time-lapse seismic images

<dl class="img first">

  </dt>
  <dd>
    In addition to vertical time shifts commonly observed in time-lapse 
    seismic images, horizontal displacements are apparent as well.
    These apparent horizontal displacements may be small relatively to seismic
    wavelengths, perhaps only 5 m at depths of 5 km, but they consistently 
    suggest an outward lateral expansion of images away from a compacting 
    reservoir.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    It is well known that apparent vertical displacements are caused mostly 
    by a decrease in seismic wave velocities above compacting reservoirs.
    Those same velocity changes contribute to horizontal displacements.
    This contribution can be computed from the velocity changes that, 
    in turn, can be estimated from measured vertical displacements.
    Horizontal displacements computed in this way are similar to those 
    measured, and this similarity suggests that horizontal as well as 
    vertical displacements may be largely due to velocity changes.

<h3>
A method for estimating apparent displacement

    Reliable estimates of vertical, inline and crossline components of 
    apparent displacements in time-lapse seismic images are difficult to 
    obtain for two reasons.
    First, features in 3-D seismic images tend to be locally planar, and 
    components of displacement within the planes of such features are poorly 
    resolved. 
    Second, searching directly for peaks in 3-D cross-correlations is less 
    robust, more complicated, and computationally more costly than searching 
    for peaks of 1-D cross-correlations.
    We estimate all three components of displacement with a process designed 
    to mitigate these two problems. 
    We address the first problem by computing for each image sample a local 
    phase-correlation instead of a local cross-correlation. 
    We address the second problem with a cyclic sequence of searches for 
    peaks of correlations computed for lags constrained to one of the three 
    axes of our images.

Local dip filtering with directional Laplacians

    Local dip filters attenuate or enhance features with a specified dip 
    that may vary for each image sample. 
    Because these multi-dimensional filters change with each sample, they 
    should have a small number of coefficients that can be computed
    efficiently from local dips. 
    They should handle features that are vertical as well as horizontal. 
    They should have efficient and stable inverses that facilitate
    the design and application of more discriminate notch filters. 
    Local dip filters constructed from approximations to directional 
    Laplacians have these properties and are easily implemented in any 
    number of dimensions.

    Consider two multi-dimensional digital signals, each with S samples.
    For some number of lags L (L much less than S), the cost of computing 
    a single cross-correlation of these two signals is proportional to 
    S&times;L.
    By exploiting several properties of Gaussian windows, we can compute 
    S <em>local</em> cross-correlations, again with computational cost 
    proportional to S&times;L.
    Here, <em>local</em> means the cross-correlation of signals after 
    applying a Gaussian window centered on a single sample.
    Computational cost is independent of the size of the window.

    An efficient method for computing local auto-correlations leads to a new 
    method for local adaptive prediction or prediction error filtering of 
    multi-dimensional images. 
    Using a conjugate-gradient method for least-squares optimization, we 
    compute a different prediction filter for each sample in an image. 
    These adaptive prediction filters preserve locally coherent signals, 
    while attenuating random noise.

    Gaussian or Gaussian derivative filtering is in several ways optimal
    for applications requiring low-pass filters or running averages.
    For short filters with lengths of a dozen samples or so, 
    direct convolution with a finite-length approximation to a Gaussian
    is the best implementation.
    However, for longer filters such as those used in computing running
    averages, recursive implementations may be much more efficient.
    Based on the filter length, we select one of two popular methods for 
    designing and implementing recursive Gaussian filters.

    We construct simple reservoir models with a small number of flow units,

    We call these units <em>tanks</em> and connect them with <em>tubes</em>.
    For such simple models, we may interactively adjust reservoir properties,
    such as porosities of tanks and transmissibilities of tubes, and then
    simulate fluid flow <em>during</em> seismic interpretation.
    Numerical experiments suggest that parameters we estimate for coarse

    A first step in seismic interpretation is seismic image segmentation.
    For most seismic images, with incompletely or poorly imaged faults and 
    horizons, global methods for segmentation are more robust than local 
    event tracking or region growing methods often used today.
    The disadvantage of global image segmentation methods has been their 
    relatively high computational cost.
    We reduce this cost by applying these methods to a space-filling mesh 
    aligned automatically with features in seismic images.
    The mesh makes global segmentation of 3-D seismic images feasible.

    Today's work cycle from seismic imaging to reservoir simulation 
    requires a variety of data structures - simple arrays, triangulated 
    surfaces, non-manifold frameworks, corner-point grids, etc. - to 
    represent the earth's subsurface. 
    Conversions among these different representations are both time 
    consuming and error prone.
    Using simple image processing techniques, we automatically align a 
    lattice of points (atoms) with horizons and faults in a seismic image. 
    Connecting these points yields an unstructured space-filling polyhedral 
    (atomic) mesh. 
    This single data structure can integrate multiple tasks, such as seismic 
    interpretation, reservoir characterization, and flow simulation, thereby 
    reducing work cycle times and errors.

    By combining a digital image with a lattice of points called 
    <em>atoms</em>, in which atom coordinates are computed to minimize 
    a potential energy function of the combination, we obtain a mesh 
    suitable for further computations.
    Each atom in the lattice contributes a potential function to an 
    atomic potential field. 
    The image represents another potential field. 
    Total potential energy of the lattice is a weighted sum of the 
    atomic and image potential fields, evaluated at atom coordinates. 
    Beginning with a pseudo-regular lattice, a generic optimization 
    algorithm moves atoms to minimize this total potential energy.
    After optimization, we connect the atoms to form a mesh that tends 
    to be aligned with image features.
