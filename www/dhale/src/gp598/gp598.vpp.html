<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Geophysicists today use some of the most powerful computers in the world.
This is partly because geophysical data volumes are vast and growing.
Another reason is that raw geophysical data are not easily understood,
and typically require substantial processing, visualization and analysis 
before we can make sense of them.
</p>
<p>
This course emphasizes computational solutions most applicable to 
geophysical problems that require multidimensional image processing, 
interpolation and gridding of sparse data, and numerical solutions
to partial differential equations.
Our solutions will include aspects of multi-language programming, 
efficient algorithms, data structures beyond simple arrays, 
memory management, multicore parallel computing, and graphical 
visualizations.
</p>
<p>
A large part of this course is the application of these solutions
to problems encountered by students in their own research.
Although this course is designed for graduate students in geophysics,
others with a strong interest in scientific computing are welcome with 
permission of the instructor.

<h3 class="newpage">Student absences from class, labs, or exams</h3>
All students are advised to be familiar with CSM’s policy regarding 
the make-up of work missed due to excused absences.  
This policy may be found in the Bulletin.  
If a student is ill and exhibits flu-like symptoms, they should not 
attend class, labs, or exams.  
For this particular flu season, the Centers for Disease Control are 
discouraging those who are ill and without serious complications from 
visiting a health clinic or physician thus it will be difficult for 
students to obtain written documentation of their illness for the 
Associate Dean of Students and for faculty. In order for an absence 
based on illness to be excused, the student must normally communicate 
directly with the Associate Dean of Students or his/her instructors.  
To make this notification process easier, particularly in the case of 
students suffering flu-like symptoms, we have created a web-based 
certification system, and strongly encourage students to use this system 
to automatically notify all of their instructors regarding their illness.  
Here is a link to this 
<a href="http://inside.mines.edu/Flu">web-based form.</a>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
Computers in GC 297 run Ubuntu, a GNU/Linux operating system.
These systems include open-source software that you can freely 
download and install on your own computers.
Most (if not all) students will want to use their own computers,
with their preferred operating systems and programming environments.
</p>
<p>
However, all students should download and install
<a href="http://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>,
a portable system for building computer programs.
The
<a href="http://www.scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user/index.html">
SCons User Guide</a> includes instructions for installing this software,
even on computers for which you do not have administrative privileges.
</p>
<p>
If not already installed on your computers, 
I recommend that you also download and install 
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
For 2-D graphics and plotting with Python, I like
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib (pylab)</a>,
which includes
<a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>.
</p>
<p>
However, because I write a lot of software in 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/javase">Java</a>, I typically use
<a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>, which is Python for
Java programmers.
</p>
