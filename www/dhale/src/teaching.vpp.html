    We live in a digital world.
    Speech, image, video, almost any signal worth measuring today is a 
    sampled function of time, space, or both.
    In this course we learn the special characteristics of these digital 
    signals, and how to analyze and enhance them with computers.

    In science and engineering today, we implement, simulate, and
    test new ideas with computer software.
    During their careers Mines graduates will use some of the world's 
    most powerful computing machines.
    This course is a first step towards using them well.

<h3>Geophysical Computing</h3>

    Geophysical data volumes are vast and growing, and raw geophysical 
    data are not easily understood. To make sense of these data today
    requires 2D, 3D and 4D image processing, numerical solutions of 
    partial differential equations, data structures beyond simple 
    arrays, interactive graphics, and parallel computing on 
    increasingly multicore systems, using multiple programming 
    languages and frameworks. Let's do this.

    Recent advances in sensor technologies have created new opportunities
    for intelligent geosystems that sense and adapt to their environments. 
    This course is an interdisciplinary survey of technologies required to 
    develop such systems.

<h3>Data Structures</h3>

    An array of numbers is a simple and well-known data structure.
    In this course, we learn to create and use other data structures, 
    such as binary trees, linked lists, and hash tables, to solve 
    problems in science and engineering.

<h3>My teachers</h3>
<p>
To succeed we all need help from teachers and mentors.
I've had some great ones. 
Here are just a few:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cwp.mines.edu/~klarner">
    Ken Larner</a> taught me to never be impressed by complexity;
    rather, to look for simple lasting insights, especially in 
    scientific writing and speaking.
    The wisdom in Ken's 
    <a href="${base}/other/KenGuidelinesForSpeaking.html"> 
      guidelines for presentations</a>
    is timeless.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/jon/">Jon Claerbout</a> 
    taught me seismic imaging and founded the 
    <a href="http://sepwww.stanford.edu">Stanford Exploration Project</a> 
    where my fellow graduate students taught me much more.
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutt_Bridges">Rutt Bridges</a> 
    is a master of finding win-win solutions in both business and public
    policy. Among other things, Rutt taught me the difference between a great
    idea and a successful business. (Hint: you need a Rutt.)
  </li>
</ul>
