<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
In science and engineering today, we implement, simulate, and
test new ideas with computer software.
During their careers Mines graduates will use some of the world's 
most powerful computing machines.
This course is a first step towards using them well.
</p>
<p>
We will begin by programming computers to respond to changing 
parameters, to make decisions based on those parameters, and
to print the results of our calculations.
We will learn to use arrays to process sequences and images, to read 
such data from files, and to display them graphically.
As we learn, our programs will tend to become more complex.
We will reduce this complexity with object-oriented programming,
wrapping our data in <em>classes</em> with <em>methods</em> 
that keep those data consistent and our programs simple and robust.
</p>
<p>
Complexity in computer programs is bad, and
object-oriented programming (OOP) reduces complexity. 
The technique of OOP is what's important, 
more than the language we do it in.
But among languages that support object-oriented programming
and meet other requirements of science and engineering today, 
Java is simplest.
Remember, simplicity is good, complexity is bad.

<h3 class="newpage">Grading</h3>
<p>
Your course grade is based on
</p>
<ul>
  <li>40%: programming assignments</li>
  <li>30%: midterm exams (two)</li>
  <li>30%: final exam</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Programming</h4>
<p>
You will typically receive a programming assignment each Monday
that is due before class begins the following Monday.
(Exceptions are the weeks of Spring Break and exams.)
Assignments will be posted on Blackboard.
</p>
<p>
You will receive assignments and submit your computer programs 
electronically on Blackboard.
You must also submit a printed copy of your programs, as these will 
be annotated during grading and are helpful when reviewing for exams.
</p>
<p>
Grades for programming assignments will be determined roughly as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>105: exceptional; exceeds requirements with elegance and simplicity.</li>
<li> 95: excellent; meets all requirements, well done.</li>
<li> 85: satisfactory; with a few minor flaws.</li>
<li> 75: unsatisfactory; incomplete or with major flaws.</li>
<li> 65: poor; seriously flawed, but with some effort.</li>
<li> 55 (and lower): failing; with little or no effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A grade exceeding 100 will be rare, and can be earned only for
more difficult assignments.
</p>

<h4>Late work</h4>
<p>
<em>Late work will not be accepted.</em>
If you submit work late, it will not be graded, and you will receive a 
grade of zero for that assignment.
Because each programming assignment builds upon previous assignments,
it is important that you not fall behind. 
</p>
<p>
Students with excused absences (e.g., for athletics) will be permitted to 
complete alternative programming assignments with different due dates.
</p>

<h3 class="newpage">Working with others</h3>
<p>
<cite>
"Your code is like your boyfriend or girlfriend. It's okay to talk about
it on an abstract, high level. But you don't want to go into the specific
details, and you certainly don't want to share."
</cite>
- Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck, Brown University, 1997
</p>
<p>
The following policy applies to all Computer Science courses at Mines:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  If the project is an individual effort, you are not allowed to give code 
  you have developed to another student or use code provided by another 
  student.  If the project is a group effort, you are allowed to share 
  code only with members of your group. 
  </li>
  <li>
  You are encouraged to discuss programming projects with other students in 
  the class, provided that:
  <ul>
    <li>
    You view another student's code only for the purpose of offering 
    debugging assistance to that student, not to help yourself.
    </li>
    <li>
    Other students give advice to you only on what problems to look for. 
    They do not debug your code for you, and they never by any means
    provide their solutions to you. <em>You</em> write <em>your</em> code.
    </li>
    <li>
    You follow the empty hands rule, which means that you leave the 
    discussion with no (electronic, mechanical or other) record of it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  Any materials from outside sources, such as books, projects, and,
  especially, the Web, should be properly referenced and should be used 
  only if specifically allowed for the assignment.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you are aware of students violating this policy, you are encouraged to 
  inform the course instructor.
  Violations of this policy will be treated as academic misconduct by all 
  students involved.
  See the Undergraduate Bulletin for a description of the Student Honor Code.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
<em>
For CSCI 261J assume that all projects are individual efforts.

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
If you use Linux or Windows on your computer, 
you should download and install the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">
Java SE Development Kit (JDK)</a>.
Get both JDK (not JRE) 6 and the Java SE 6 Documentation.
If you use Mac OS X, you should already have the JDK on
your computer, but if not you can download it from Apple.
</p>
<p>
Windows computers in the CTLM labs at Mines have the 
Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) installed.
You should also download and install the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/ganymede/sr2/">
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (Ganymede)</a>.
This is the version of Eclipse that is currently installed on 
computers in the CTLM labs.
Alternatively, perhaps because your computer (or operating system) 
is relatively new, then you may instead install the more recent 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (Galileo)</a>.
In either case, download the 
<em>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</em>,
not the much larger 
<em>Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers</em>.
</p>
<p>
Some assignments will require the
<a href="http://www.mines.edu/~dhale/jtk/index.html">
Mines Java Toolkit</a>.
You will use this, but need not build it yourself.
</p>

<h3>Happiness</h3>
<p>
  Some people have great ideas but are frustrated because they cannot 
  implement them. Others know how to do things, but are unsatisfied
  making someone else's great ideas work. The happiest people I know
  have the ability and responsibility to implement their own ideas.
</p>
